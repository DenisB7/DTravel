# 								DTravel

**DTravel** - Django Framework project about travel.

Some information:
- without accounts and payments :)
- deployed on Heroku

This is really better version of this (consists of 2 parts) [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter1 (beginning) and this one [github]: https://github.com/DenisB7/stepik_chapter2 (continue)

**This project was a homework of course** from [Stepik]: https://stepik.org/


I've spent a lot of time refactoring this project and it worth it.

I'm new in Django and programming, and always trying to improve my skills.
